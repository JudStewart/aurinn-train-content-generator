[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/fantasy-content-generator.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fantasy-content-generator)

_[Very WIP!]_

> Generate fantasy content for your app, video game, website and more

## Installing

The library can be used as a NPM module or imported directly into a webpage.

### Node/Webpack

`npm install --save fantasy-content-generator`

```js
const FCG = require('fantasy-content-generator');

FCG.Names.orc(); // 'Dunzub Gruulbav'
```

### Direct `<script>` Include

Download `./fantasy_content_generator.js` direct from Github and include in a script tag like

```html
<script src="./fantasy_content_generator.js"></script>
```

The API will be available on the global `window.FantasyContentGenerator` object.

```js
window.FantasyContentGenerator.Names.orc(); // 'Dunzub Gruulbav'
```

## API Reference

Examples given from a base of

```js
const FCG = require('fantasy-content-generator');
```

but all API methods work with the direct `<script>` include too.

### `Names`

Generate names for a race and gender, based on D&D 5E. All base races in the 5E PHB are supported.

**Functions**

- `generate();`
- `dragonborn();`
- `dwarf();`
- `elf();`
- `gnome();`
- `halfElf();`
- `halfOrc();`
- `halfling();`
- `human();`
- `tiefling();`

```js
FCG.Names.generate({ race: 'elf', gender: 'male' }) // 'Hadarai Liadon'
```

If no race and/or gender given, one will be chosen at random for each.

```js
FCG.Names.generate(); // 'Sutha Chernin', a female Half-Orc
```

Names based on race can also be generated by calling the race directly on the `Names` object as a function.

```js
FCG.Names.elf(); // an elf with a random gender
FCG.Names.elf({ gender: 'female' }); // a female elf
```

### `Storyhooks`

Generate short, interesting things to happen that can spur on an encounter or spice things up if they're getting stale.

**Functions**

- `npcActs();`

**NPC Acts**

An NPC does something.

```js
FCG.Storyhooks.npcActs(); // 'An NPC becomes fearful'
```

### `NPCs`

Generate NPCs

**Functions**

- `generate();`

A generated NPC will have a race, a gender, a name (based on the race and gender), 1-2 random character traits, and 1-2 random character flaws.

```js
FCG.NPCs.generate();

/*
{
  name: 'Silaqui Liadon',
  gender: 'female',
  race: 'elf',
  traits: [
    'Collects hair of slain opponents'
  ],
  flaws: [
    'Deep down, I know I only do this for the thrill.',
    'I am very impatient. I must have everything immediately.'
  ]
}
*/
```

Race and gender parameters can be given to generate to ensure those values.

## Tests

```
npm test
```

to run the Jest tests.

##Â Contributing

Open up a PR!

As a general rule of thumb, aim to only use/reference content that is totally custom, or available in the PHB of D&D 5E.
